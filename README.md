# Obsidian Color Highlight Plugin

currently in development of a color highlight in obsidian

- added a red color highlight using the `ctrl + shift + j` to highlight the selected text to red.

plans:
- build different colored text 
- implement methods using the document element instead of the mathjax format(current implementation)
